## What I Learned

Through this module, I have gained a solid foundation in Python programming, including:

- Understanding Python’s syntax and structure.
- Working with variables, data types, and sequences.
- Using conditional statements and loops to control program flow.
- Writing reusable functions and organizing code with modules.
- Exploring advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, and decorators.
- Handling exceptions to build robust applications.
- Practical knowledge of Python's built-in data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

This repository was created as a resource for practical learning, where concepts were reinforced through hands-on exercises and examples.
